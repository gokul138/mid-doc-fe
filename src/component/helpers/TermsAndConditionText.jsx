            Analytics - Data Geniee’s views. If Output references any third
            party products or services, it doesn’t mean the third party endorses
            or is affiliated with Finsight Analytics - Data Geniee. Our IP
            Rights We and our affiliates own all rights, title, and interest in
            and to the Services. You may only use our name and logo in

            AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
            PROVISIONS: MANDATORY ARBITRATION. You and Finsight Analytics - Data
            Geniee agree to resolve any claims arising out of or relating to
            these Terms or our Services, regardless of when the claim arose,
            even if it was before these Terms existed (a “Dispute”), through
            final and binding arbitration. You may opt out of arbitration within
            30 days of account creation or of any updates to these arbitration
            terms within 30 days after the update has taken effect by writing to
            us below email. If you opt out of an update, the last set of agreed
            upon arbitration terms will apply. Informal Dispute Resolution. We
            would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to
            formal legal action. Before either of us files a claim against the
            other, we both agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally. You
            agree to do so by sending us notice through this email given below.
            We will do so by sending you notice to the email address associated
            with your account. If we are unable to resolve a Dispute within 60
            days, either of us has the right to initiate arbitration. We also
            both agree to attend an individual settlement conference if either
            party requests one during this time. Any statute of limitations will
            be tolled during this informal resolution process. Arbitration
            Forum. If we are unable to resolve the Dispute, either of us may
            commence arbitration with National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”)
            under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures
            and/or Supplemental Rules for Mass Finsight Analytics - Data Geniee
            will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the
            arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. The activities
            described in these Terms involve interstate commerce and the Federal
            Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of
            these arbitration terms and any arbitration. Arbitration Procedures.
            The arbitration will be conducted by videoconference if possible,
            but if the arbitrator determines a hearing should be conducted in
            person, the location will be mutually agreed upon, in the county
            where you reside, or as determined by the arbitrator, unless the
            batch arbitration process applies. The arbitration will be conducted
            by a sole arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge
            or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of India. The
            arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute,
            except the state or federal courts of San Francisco, India have the
            authority to determine any Dispute about enforceability, validity of
            the class action waiver, or requests for public injunctive relief,
            as set out below. Any settlement offer amounts will not be disclosed
            to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator
            determines the final award, if any. The arbitrator has the authority
            to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.
            Exceptions. This section does not require informal dispute
            resolution or arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual
            claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other
            equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services
            or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. CLASS AND
            JURY TRIAL WAIVERS. You and Finsight Analytics - Data Geniee agree
            that Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and may
            not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
            class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class
            arbitrations, class actions, and representative actions are
            prohibited. Only individual relief is available. The parties agree
            to sever and litigate in court any request for public injunctive
            relief after completing arbitration for the underlying claim and all
            other claims. This does not prevent either party from participating
            in a class-wide settlement. You and Finsight Analytics - Data Geniee
            knowingly and irrevocably waive any right to trial by jury in any
            action, proceeding, or counterclaim. Batch Arbitration. If 25 or
            more claimants represented by the same or similar counsel file
            demands for arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes
            within 90 days of each other, then you and Finsight Analytics - Data
            Geniee agree that NAM will administer them in batches of up to 50
            claimants each (“Batch”), unless there are less than 50 claimants in
            total or after batching, which will comprise a single Batch. NAM
            will administer each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with
            one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees, and one hearing held by
            videoconference or in a location decided by the arbitrator for each
            Batch. If any part of this section is found to be invalid or
            unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, it will be
            severed and arbitrated in individual proceedings. Severability. If
            any part of these arbitration terms is found to be illegal or
            unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a
            finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class
            arbitration, class action, or representative action, this entire
            dispute resolution section will be unenforceable in its entirety.

            Data geniee generate responses by reading a user’s request and, in
            response, predicting the words most likely to appear next. In some
            cases, the words most likely to appear next may not be the most
            factually accurate. For this reason, you should not rely on the
            factual accuracy of output from our models. If you notice that Data
            geniee output contains factually inaccurate information about you
            and you would like us to correct the inaccuracy, you may submit a
            correction request through support@finsightanalytics.org. Given the
            technical complexity of how our models work, we may not be able to
            correct the inaccuracy in every instance. For information on how to
            exercise your rights with respect to data we have collected from the
            internet to train our models, please see this help center article.
